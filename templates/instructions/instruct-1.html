    <h1>Instructions</h1>

    <hr>

    <p>In this experiment, you will play with a group of other MTurk workers as members of an "investment club". Across multiple rounds you will choose whether to contribute to the club's investment fund and whether to hire accountants and investigators. Accountants will fine members of the club who did not contribute to the investment fund, and investigators will fine club members who did not hire an accountant.</p>
    
    <p>The decisions you make will cause you to gain or lose "points", and your total number of points at the end of the study will determine your bonus payment. Specifically, each point is worth $0.01 with the bonus capped at $1 (this is in addition to your base pay of $1). It is possible to lose enough points that you will not get any bonus.</p>
