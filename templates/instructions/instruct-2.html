    <h1>Instructions</h1>

    <hr>
    <p>On every round, your first choice is whether or not to contibute to the club's investment fund. Doing so will cost you 10 points, however the club's investors are excellent and they guarantee to double the value of any investments every round. The total return on the investment fund is shared equally amongst all the club members - even those who did not personally contribute.</p>
    <p>If everyone contributes, everyone will gain 10 points (they will contribute 10, and get back 20), and if no-one contributes, no-one will gain or lose any points. However, if some members contribute, but others don't, then those who contributed will gain fewer points than those who did not contribute and they may even lose points.</p>

    <p>You may also be given the choice to hire an accountant. Your accountant will fine other club members who did not contribute to the investment fund. Hiring an accountant costs you 1 point for every club member the accountant fines, but being fined costs 5 points. Other players can hire an accountant too and the fines from accountants stack, so if 4 club members hire an accountant then club members who did not contribute to the investment fund will lose 20 points.</p>

    <p>Finally, you may also be given the choice to hire an investigator. Like an accountant, an investigator costs points to hire and can fine other club members. However, investigators fine members who did not hire an accountant. As with the accountant, hiring an investigator will cost you 1 point for every club member the investigator fines, and each person fined will lose 5 points, with fines stacking if multiple club members hire an investigator.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Two notes:</p>
    <p>1. Accountants and investigators are not always available for hire, but you will be told whether they are available for hire at the start of every round.</p>
    <p>2. Your own accountant or investigator will not fine you. So, even if you didn't contribute to the investment fund, your own accountant will not fine you. However, other club members' accountants will still fine you.</p>
